<h2>A LETTER FROM MY HEART</h2>

<p class="box scroll">
Dear Khadidja,<br><br>
In every version of the day, near or far, you are where my heart goes first.
You are my calm, my chaos, my favorite thought.
Loving you feels natural, like breathing.
Thank you for being my safe place, my smile, my home.
<br><br>
I love you more than words can hold 💖
<br><br>
You are the one decision I would make a thousand times over without a secound thought,
You are the kind of beauty that artists dreak of capturing,
<br><br>
If only you could see yourself through my eyes,
Perhaps then you would understand why I marvel at your beauty so quietly, 
Why your presence steal my words,
while leaving my heart full of things it long to say.
<br><br>
If you could see yourself through my eyes, 
you would understand why I believe in god,
because existence feels deliberate, 
crafted with intention, touched with care, 
shaped by a hand that knew exactly what was doing.
<br><br>
You are not an accident, you are grace made visible, 
a testament to divine patience and gentle design.
<br><br>
If only you could see yourself through my eyes Khadidja.
