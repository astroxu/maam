<h2>A LETTER FROM MY HEART</h2>

<p class="box">
Dear Khadidja,<br><br>
In every version of the day, near or far, you are where my heart goes first.
You are my calm, my chaos, my favorite thought.
Loving you feels natural, like breathing.
Thank you for being my safe place, my smile, my home.
<br><br>
I love you more than words can hold 💖
<br><br>
IF ONLY YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF THROUGH MY EYES, PERHAPS THEN YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND
WHY I MARVEL AT YOUR BEAUTY SO QUIETLY, WHY YOUR PRESENCE STEALS MY WORDS,
WHILE LEAVING MY HEART FULL OF THINGS IT LONGS TO SAY.
<br><br>
IF YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF THROUGH MY EYES, YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND WHY I BELIEVE IN GOD,
BECAUSE EXISTENCE FEELS DELIBERATE, CRAFTED WITH INTENTION, TOUCHED WITH CARE,
SHAPED BY A HAND THAT KNEW EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS DOING.
<br><br>
YOU ARE NOT AN ACCIDENT, YOU ARE GRACE MADE VISIBLE,
A TESTAMENT TO DIVINE PATIENCE AND GENTLE DESIGN.
<br><br>
IF ONLY YOU COULD SEE YOURSELF THROUGH MY EYES KHADIDJA.
